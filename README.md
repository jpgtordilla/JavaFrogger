JAVA FROGGER

A clone of the classic arcade game, Frogger, made with the libGDX "cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, your browser and iOS" (https://libgdx.com/). 

Sprites were created using the Texture library and depict a "realistic" frog, vehicles, and backdrop. File organization is based off of Object-Oriented Design principles and best-practices outlined by the libGDX documentation. All development was done in IntelliJ in Java. This current build is only supported on Desktop.
